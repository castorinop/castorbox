          <p>
            There are multiple MiniMyth distribution versions available for download.
            In order to decide which one to download, it helps to understand the MiniMyth distribution's version.
          </p>
          <p>
            The version consists of three parts separated by hyphens (-).
            The first part is the MythTV version number.
            The second part is MiniMyth build system version number.
            The third part, which may or may not be present, is an extra version.
            For example, the version 0.19-18 means that this MiniMyth distribution contains MythTV 0.19 and was built using MiniMyth version 18.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may have noticed that the MythTV version number and the MiniMyth build system version number are independent.
            This is done because the MiniMyth build system can build multiple versions of MythTV,
            depending on the MiniMyth build system configuration settings.
            For example, The MiniMyth distributions with the versions 0.19-18 and 0.20-18 would contain different versions of MythTV,
            but would have been built using the same MiniMyth build system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, the extra version is used to indicate that the MiniMyth distribution was built
            using one or more non-default MiniMyth build system configuration settings.
            Usually, this is done only when providing test builds for troubleshooting.
            As a result, stable MiniMyth distribution versions rarely have an extra version.

            </dt>
            <dd>
              A directory containing the latest stable MiniMyth release.
              The latest stable MiniMyth release is usually the latest stable version of MiniMyth with the latest stable version of MythTV.
              For the latest stable MiniMyth release with an older stable MythTV release
              visit the <a href="http://linpvr.org/minimyth/download/stable/old/">old stable MiniMyth releases</a> directory.

              (<strong> <!--#include file="download/test/latest/version"--></strong>)
            </dt>
            <dd>
              A directory containing the latest test MiniMyth release.
              There is not always a test MiniMyth release.
              As result, this directory is sometimes empty.
            </dd>

              <a href="http://linpvr.org/minimyth/download/stable/">All stable MiniMyth releases</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              A directory containing "all" stable MiniMyth releases.
              In order to preserve server space,
              not every stable MiniMyth release is kept indefinitely.
            </dd>
            <dt id="test">
              <a href="http://linpvr.org/minimyth/download/test/">All test MiniMyth releases</a>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              A directory containing all test MiniMyth releases.
              When a new stable or test MiniMyth release is added, old test MiniMyth releases are usually deleted.
              Therefore, there is usually only one test MiniMyth release.
              However, at times there are multiple test MiniMyth releases because we are testing multiple things
              (e.g., MiniMyth with different versions of MythTV).

            <dd>
              A directory containing all MiniMyth releases created before MiniMyth was built using the GAR build system.

            <dd>
              A directory mirroring some of the source code used by MiniMyth's GAR build system.
              This is done to minimize the impact caused by the scheduled and unscheduled outages of servers (e.g. sourceforge.net).
              As a result, only source code hosted on servers where outages have been a problem is mirrored here.
