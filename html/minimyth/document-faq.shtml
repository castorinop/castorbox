        <div id="dvd" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why can I play some DVDs but not other DVDs?</div>
          <p>
            There are two possible reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first reason is that some DVDs are encrypted using CSS.
            In order to play these DVDs, you need libdvdcss.so.2.
            Because of legal issues surrounding other software that allows Linux users to play their legally purchased DVDs,
            libdvdcss.so.2 is not included in the binary MiniMyth distribution.
            Although libdvdcss.so.2 is very different from this other software, legal concerns still exist.
            Because, libdvdcss.so.2 only depends on Linux and glibc,
            you should be able to use any libdvdcss.so.2 that has been compiled for i386, i486 or i586.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have a copy of libdvdcss.so.2,
            you can add it to your MiniMyth frontend at boot by including it in your extras file system
            (see the
            <a href="document-minimyth_conf.shtml#MM_EXTRAS_URL">MM_EXTRAS_URL</a>
            variable in the MiniMyth configuration file).
            If you compile MiniMyth yourself,
            then the extras file system image that the build system creates contains libdvdcss.so.2.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second reason is that some DVD drives require their region code to be set.
            You can use the 'regionset' utility that is included in MiniMyth to set the region code for your DVD drive.
            For information on how to use 'regionset', see the
            <a href="http://linvdr.org/download/regionset/README">regionset readme</a>.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="plugin-crippled" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why is my favorite Myth plugin crippled it MiniMyth?</div>
          <p>
            Some functionality of Myth plugins included in MiniMyth is missing due to the nature of MiniMyth.
          </p>
          <p>
            MiniMyth is a small distribution.
            To keep MiniMyth a small distribution, certain large packages such as Perl are not included in MiniMyth.
            As a result, Myth plugin functionality that depends on these packages does not work.
          </p>
          <p>
            As of version 0.17_2, MythStream includes parsers that do not depend on Perl.
            Therefore, if you want parser support in MythStream,
            then upgrade to a version of MiniMyth that includes at least MythStream 0.17_2.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time for a rant.
            I like Perl.
            I use it for many things.
            However, why would someone make Myth plugin functionality depend on Perl?
            After spending the effort to write most of the Myth plugin in C/C++,
            they make some small part of the Myth plugin depend on Perl.
            Since the functions provided by Perl (e.g. regular expression parsing, XML document parsing, HTTP protocol support)
            are available in small shared libraries,
            there is no reason to make a small Myth plugin
            depend on the large Perl and Perl modules.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="plugin-missing" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why is my favorite Myth plugin missing from MiniMyth?</div>
          <p>
            There are two reasons that some Myth plugins are not included in MiniMyth:
            the plugin has not been requested, and
            the plugin depends on software that is not included.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following plugins have not been included because they depend on software not included in MiniMyth:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>MythArchive is not included because it depends on Python.</li>
            <li>MythBrowser is not included because it depends on KDE.</li>
            <li>MythGame is not included because it depends on xmame.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div id="ssh" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why is SSH not included in MiniMyth?</div>
          <p>
            MiniMyth is not secure.
            It has no passwords.
            It runs almost everything as root.
          </p>
          <p>
            Making MiniMyth secure is difficult and unnecessary.
            It is difficult because it downloads its configuration files from a TFTP server, which is not secure by design.
            As a result, authentication and authorization would need to be handled by a remote server using a protocol such as LDAP,
            which is not typical in most people's home networks.
            It is unnecessary because the Myth protocol is not secure.
            As a result, an attacker can use the Myth protocol to do the same damage that can be done by compromising MiniMyth.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since MiniMyth is not secure, there is little reason to use a secure protocol for communication with a MiniMyth frontend.
            Therefore, including SSH would increase the size and configuration complexity of MiniMyth without increasing the security.
            As a result, SSH is not included.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="sensor" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why are my temperature and fan sensors missing or wrong?</div>
          <p>
            You may notice that you get no output from your temperature and fan sensors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for this is that the sensor chip's kernel module is not loading.
            Unfortunately there is no simple detection method for sensor chips.
            In order to "auto-detect" the sensor chip, MiniMyth goes through a two step process.
            First, MiniMyth attempts to detect the motherboard vendor and product.
            Second, MiniMyth maps the motherboard vendor and product to hardware kernel modules that are not auto-detected,
            including the sensor chip's kernel module.
            It is likely that this is not working for your motherboard, because MiniMyth does not have the necessary information.
            If you
            <a href="http://linpvr.org/bugs/">file a bug report</a>
            that contains the motherboard vendor and product, the output of the command 'dmidecode&nbsp;-t&nbsp;baseboard'
            and (if you know it) the sensor chip kernel module,
            then we can add the necessary information to MiniMyth.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may notice that either a sensor reports a temperature that is very wrong
            or a label next to a temperature or fan sensor is wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for very wrong temperature readings on VIA EPIA motherboards is
            either the specific temperature sensors are not used by the motherboard
            or there is something wrong with the vt1211 sensors driver.
            I do not know which it is.
            However, it is safe to assume that the motherboard is not at a temperature that is below freezing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason for the wrong labels is that the motherboard vendor did not wire the sensors as suggested by the sensor chip vendor.
            As a result, while the values are correct, they are attributed to the wrong temperature or fan sensors on the motherboard.
            At some point, we may add motherboard specific sensors configuration files to address this problem.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="MM_DEBUG" class="section">
          <div class="heading">Why doesn't MM_DEBUG work?</div>
          <p>
            People tend to have one of two problems when trying to enable debugging.
          </p>
          <p>
            First, they set MM_DEBUG in the wrong place.
            As mentioned in the
            <a href="document-boot.shtml#bootline">boot instructions' boot line parameters</a>
            section, MM_DEBUG="yes" must be set on the boot line.
            If it is set in the MiniMyth configuration file, then it will not work correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, they quote the MM_DEBUG variable value incorrectly.
            As mentioned in the
            <a href="document-boot.shtml#bootline">boot instructions' boot line parameters</a>
            section, unlike MiniMyth variable values in the MiniMyth configuration file which should be single quoted ('),
            MiniMyth variable values on the boot line must be either unquoted or double quoted (").
            Single quoted variable values such as MM_DEBUG='yes' will not work correctly.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div id="build" class="section">
          <div class="heading">How can I build MiniMyth from source?</div>
          <p>
            The answer to this question can be found on the

            The VIA ME6000 system and the ASUS A8N VM CSM system are used almost daily.
            When I upgrade the television to which the VIA ME6000 system connects,
            I will need to upgrade the VIA ME6000 system to a system that suppports 1080i HDTV and DVI-D.

            I do not use the VIA SP8000E system because it is on loan to a friend.
            However, since it cannot play 1080i HDTV and does not have a DVI-D output,
            it is unlikely that I will be using it in the future.

            The best way to report a bug or request a feature is to submit it to the
            <a href="http://linpvr.org/bugs/">bug tracking system</a>.
