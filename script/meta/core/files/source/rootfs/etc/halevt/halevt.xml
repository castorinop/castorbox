Remember to use &amp; and &quot; for & and " in xml attributes.

In a match attribute, hal.* is special since it matches any device.
In a match attribute property it is possible to refer to other
device properties. For example 
hal.block.storage_device.hal.storage.policy.should_mount
refers to the storage.policy.should_mount property of the block.storage_device
device associated with a given device.

In an exec attribute, $hal.udi$ is special since it is replaced by
the device udi. $hal.some.property$ is replaced by the value
of the property some.property.

Removable devices support

<!--
This rule matches removable devices which have volume.policy.should_mount true
or don't have volume.policy.should_mount false.
Upon insertion, they are mounted and recorded by halevt-mount. 
-m 002 sets the umask of mount to 002 when pmount is used system-wide
to mount the device. This allows regular users to read the device.

<!--
When a device get a mount point, it is passed to halevt-mount which can 
record it. The property that changes is volume.is_mounted, and the action is
executed when the value of volume.is_mounted becomes true.

When a device is unmounted, it is recorded by halevt-mount.

<!--
When a device is removed, it is recorded by halevt-mount.
Note that at that point the device is already out of hal, so we use
* which matches any device in the match attribute, and only pass the
udi to the command.

Example of a use of OnInit. At startup all the devices are matched and the exec
comand is run for those that match. Here we match all the removable devices
that aren't already mounted and mount and register them.

Example of a use of Condition. When a device matches and the condition has become
true for that device, the corresponding exec command is launched.
