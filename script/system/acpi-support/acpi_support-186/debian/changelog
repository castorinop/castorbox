  * lib/state-funcs, start.d/60-asus-wireless-led.sh, asus-wireless.sh:
    eliminate setLEDAsusWireless altogether; this needs to be handled
    directly by the kernel when the kill switch is toggled, not in a racy
    and inconsistently-applied manner by acpi-support; and in at least some
    cases we know this already *does* happen because of reports that
    /sys/devices/platform/asus-laptop/wlan, used for toggling "the LED" with
    the current kernel module, is actually an interface for toggling *the
    antenna* that happens to also toggle the LED.  Likewise, we should not
    be responsible for bringing up the antenna at boot, so get rid of the
    file in the start.d directory.  LP: #293943, #204378, #334368.
  * Now that the last script is gone from start.d, kill off the directory
    and the init script handling too.
  * Remove the asus-wireless-2 event handler, which is completely redundant
    with the pre-existing asus-wireless-{off,on} handlers.  LP: #207871.

    /sys interface, looking under phy80211/ instead of under device/
