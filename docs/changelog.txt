MiniMyth Changelog

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 17 (2006.09.05):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,   release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,     release-0-19-fixes branch svn 10505.
    MythTV SVN: version svn10992, trunk svn 10992.

Fixed shell scripts bug.
    None of the shell script variables in functions were scoped as local. It
        is amazing that any of the shell scripts worked. In fact, the mm_local_*
        shell scripts exhibited strange behavior as a result of this bug.

Changes since 16 (2006.09.03):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,   release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,     release-0-19-fixes branch svn 10505.
    MythTV SVN: version svn10992, trunk svn 10992.

Changed MiniMyth distribution packaging
    Separated MythTV themes into separate files.
        Themes are loaded at boot time from the distribution's 'themes'
            directory.
        Which MythTV theme and MythTV OSD theme are loaded are controlled by
            the required minimyth.conf variables MM_THEME_URL and
            MM_THEMEOSD_URL respectively.
    There are now two MiniMyth distribution files:
        sfs-<version>.tar.bz2 that contains squashfs based booting image files.
        tar-<version>.tar.bz2 that contains nfs based booting tarball files.
    sfs-<version> expands into a directory 'sfs-<version>' which contains:
        kernel : the Linux kernel
        rootfs : the MiniMyth root files system squashfs image
        themes : a directory of MythTV theme squashfs images.

Improved the local boot install and update scripts
    Renamed the install and update scripts to 'mm_local_install' and
       'mm_local_update' respectively.
    Added the 'mm_local_helper' file that is used by 'mm_local_install' and
       'mm_local_update'. This file enables the installation method to change
       between releases because this file is first downloaded from MiniMyth
       distribution directory and then used to install the distribution.
    Changed the default value for MM_UPDATE_URL to
       'http://linpvr.org/minimyth/download/stable/latest/' in order to match
       LinPVR.org's new directory structure.

Modified GAR build system
    Removed several attributes from 'minimyth.conf.mk'.
    Moved source tarball generation to 'meta/minimyth/minimyth.mk'.

Updated packages
    Updated mythtv/mythplugins-svn.
    Updated mythtv/myththemes-svn.
    Updated mythtv/mythtv-svn.
    Updated system/splashutils.
    Updated utils/m4.

Changes since 15 (2006.08.29):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,   release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,     release-0-19-fixes branch svn 10505.
    MythTV SVN: version svn10701, trunk svn 10701.

Changes since 14 (2006.08.29):

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,   release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,     release-0-19-fixes branch svn 10505.
    MythTV SVN: version svn10701, trunk svn 10701.

Changed how DCHP parameter override works
    Eliminated the 'minimyth.dhcp' file.
    Added DHCP override variables to the 'minimyth.conf' file.
    Added DHCP override hostname variable to the boot line.

Changed binary image to include Intel and NVIDIA support
    Modified default build to include Intel, INVIDIA, and VIA support.

Improved hardware autodection
    Moved most hardware autodetection from custom scripts to udev.

Changed from CRAMFS to SQUASHFS
    Files such as libmythtv have been getting bigger with each release of
        MythTV. With the latest SVN versions, libmythtv is approaching the
        cramfs 16MB file limit, even when stripped and optimized for size. To
        make sure that this file limit does not become a problem for those
        building custom versions of MiniMyth, the files system has been changed
        from cramfs to squashfs.
    The root file system (rootfs) is now a squashfs image rather than a cramfs
        image.
    Any minimyth.conf URL that supported cramfs images (*.cmg) now supports
        squashfs images (*.sfs) as well.
    The MM_EXTRAS_URL value 'default' now points to a squashfs image (*.sfs)
        rather than a cramfs image (*.cmg).

Improved local boot support.
    Added support for booting from an IDE disk to support CF-to-IDE adapters.
    Added 'mm_update' command to update the local boot partition with the
        latest files from the site pointed to by MM_UPDATE_URL (which is
        'http://linprv.org/dnload/releases/latest/' by default).
    Removed the need for the MM_BOOT_TYPE boot line parameter.
    Improved the 'mkusbkey' script to better support card readers.
    Renamed the 'mkusbkey' script from 'mkusbkey' to 'mkflashboot'.
    Modified udev scripts to mount any IDE or SCSI (for USB) disk/partition
        with the label 'minimyth' as the directory '/minimyth'.
    Modified the init scripts to treat '/minimyth' rather than the TFTP server 
        as the boot directory when '/minimyth' is present.
    The disk/partition with the 'minimyth' label must be formatted as a FAT
        filesystem.

Improved init scripts
    Added lcdproc to start LCDproc server, and associated MM_LCDPROC_DRIVER
        minimyth.conf variable to set the LCDproc display driver.
    Added autodetection of USB remote control receivers and LCD/VFD displays.

Cleaned up configuration
    Made init scripts more robust by using absolute paths to binaries.
    Moved /root/.xinitrc to /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.
    Moved /root/.x11vnc to /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/x11vnc.
    Moved /root/.xscreensaver to /usr/share/X11/app-defaults/XScreenSaver.

Cleaned up web server
    Changed http://<server>/ so that the file system is not browsable.
    Added http://<server>:8080/ for browsing the file system.

Fixed problem with the VIA VT1617a's analog power consumption
    Applied Andrey Liakhovets's patch sent to the
        openchrome-users@openchrome.org mailing list on 18 August 2006.
    The bad analog power consumption results in bad sound on some setups that
        use the VIA VT1617a, including some setups with VIA EPIA SP
        motherboards.

Added debug option to the GAR based build system
    Controlled using the mm_DEBUG variable in minimyth.conf.mk.
    When enabled (mm_DEBUG="yes"):
        Packages are compiled with the '-g' option.
        Packages are configured for debug (not all packages have updated yet).
        Symbols are not stripped when creating the MiniMyth image.
        Debugging software is included in the MiniMyth image, including
            'strace', 'gdb' and 'valgrind'.

    Added /etc/hardware/motherboard.<motherboard>.conf files for manually
        configuration hardware that is not autodetected. For most motherboards,
        this is the sensors.
    NOTICE: The map files are incomplete. If your motherboard is supported
        but your audio, video or other hardware does not work, then please report
        your motherboard and the output of 'lspci -mn' to
        <http://linpvr.org/forum/>.

Changes since 12:

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,   release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,     release-0-19-fixes branch svn 10143.
    MythTV SVN: version svn10177, trunk svn 10177.

Added support for booting from a USB key
    Created a script (mkusbkey) for creating a USB key that boots MiniMyth.
    Modified init scripts to read conf files from the USB key when MiniMyth is
        booted from the USB key and MM_BOOT_TYPE=usb is added to the boot
        command line.
    Added support for the conf file minimyth.dhcp when MiniMyth is booted from
        the USB key and MM_BOOT_TYPE=usb is added to the boot command line.
        The minimyth.dhcp file allows some parameters normally recieved from
        the DHCP server to be read from the minimyth.dhcp file.
    Warning it has been observed that booting VIA EPIA M and VIA EPIA MII
        motherboards from a USB key is too slow to be useful. It is not known
        what causes this problem, but since it does not happen on the ASUS
        A8N-VM CSM motherboard, it is likely a problem with the VIA EPIA
        motherboards. It is not known how to work around this problem. It is not
        known whether or not other VIA EPIA motherboards have this problem.

Changed xorg
    Changed default xorg from 'old' to 'new'.

Fixed bugs:
    Fixed bug that caused init to fail when wake-on-lan is enabled.
    Fixed bug in QT build configuration that caused playback of large files to
        fail.
    Patched MythTV to fix problem that caused higher resolution HDTV playback to
        fail on CN400 based motherboards, but it does not appear to work.
    Fixed problem with network service startup delay when local name cannot
        be resolved by DNS. Now DHCP creates a local /etc/hosts file and ns is
        configured to check the local /etc/hosts file first.

Improved the robustness of the GAR based build system
    Added explicit check for $(HOME)/.minimyth/minimyth.conf.mk.
    Added explicit check for binaries that must be installed for the build
        system to run correctly.
    Reduced the probability the non build system binaries are used
        unintentionally by the build system. Changed the binary search path 
        environment variable (PATH) so that it only includes build system
        directories, and created symbolic links in a build system directory
        for the binaries that must be installed for the build system to run
        correctly.
    Added packages that compile native environment replacements for most of the
        binaries that must be installed for the build system to run correctly
        (excluding: cvs, svn and wget, because they are only used for fetching
        source code; su, because it must be suid; getconf and ldconfig,
        because we do not replace the native environment glibc libraries; and
        perl, because it is large and takes time to compile).
    Improved error handling when CVS and SVN repositories fail during fetch.

Added packages
    Added devel/build-system-bins.
    Added devel/patch.
    Added utils/bash.
    Added utils/bzip2.
    Added utils/diffutils.
    Added utils/dmidecode.

    Updated system/zoneinfo.
    Updated X11/nvidia.
    Updated xorg-new/xf86-video-openchrome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.19.0.1:

Current MythTV versions
    MythTV 18:  version 0.18.2,  release-0-18-fixes branch svn 8525.
    MythTV 19:  version 0.19,    release-0-19-fixes branch svn 9806.
    MythTV SVN: version svn9056, trunk svn 9056.

Changed version numbering scheme
    The build system is capable of building different veresion of Myth.
        As a result, it makes sense to have two independent numbers: one that
        tracks the Myth version and one that tracks the MiniMyth version.
        Therefore, the version number is <Myth-version>-<MiniMyth-version>.

Changed window manager
    Returned to ratpoison, since the new version appears to work with the
        newer versions of X and the Openchrome driver.
    Removed aewm, including X11/aewm and X11/lesstif.

Changed fonts
    Made all TTF aware applications use luxi*.ttf fonts.
    Removed all other TTF fonts.
    Removed all misc fonts except those required by Xorg, ratposion and rxvt.

Changed Xorg so that the build system supports both 6.8.2 and 7.0
    Moved xorg/fontconfig and xorg/freetype to lib/fontconfig and
        lib/freetype.
    Moved xorg to xorg-new.
    Added xorg-old for 6.8.2.
    Added mm_XORG_VERSION to minimyth.conf.mk.
    Added xorg/xorg that picks either xorg-old/xorg or xorg-new/xorg depending
        on mm_XORG_VERSION, with xorg-old/xorg beging the default.
    Made kernel/drm version depend on mm_XORG_VERSION.

Updated packages
    Reverted db/mysql (apparently MythTV 0.18.1 has problems with MySQL 5.0).
    Updated lib/ffmpeg.
    Reverted lib/libpng (newer version does not compile for x86_64).
    Updated kernel/alsa-driver.
    Updated kernel/drm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.19:

Added Intel support
    Added initial support for Intel chipset based motherboards. Currently,
        there is untested support for the Commell LV-675 motherboard.
    By default, Intel support is not included in the binaries. To add Intel
        support to the binaries, set mm_CHIPSETS to 'intel via' in
        minimyth.conf.mk.

Added master backend wake-on-lan support
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_MYTH_WOL_ENABLED, MM_MYTH_WOL_MAC,
        MM_MYTH_WOLSQLRECONNECTWAITTIME, MM_MYTH_WOLSQLCONNECTRETRY, and
        MM_MYTH_WOLSQLCOMMAND for controlling wake-on-lan behavior.
    Added package 'net/wakelan'.

Updated init
    Moved checking of DHCP provided values until after the telnet daemon
        is started so that users can debug DCHP problems by telnetting in.
    Changed MM_HARDWARE_* values to include both the manufacturer name and
        part number, not just the part number. With the inclusion of Intel
        and NVIDIA based motherboards, it was getting confusing.

Moved packages
    Moved utils/strace to devel/strace.

Added packages
    Added net/wakelan.
    Added xorg/xdpycopy.

    Updated utils/busybox.
    Updated xorg/libdrm.
    Updated xorg/xf86-video-openchrome.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.11:

Added CD and DVD ripping support
    CD ripping supports transcoding. MythMusic requires the audio encoders
        independent of whether or not you want to include CD ripping.
    DVD ripping does not support transcoding. MythDVD uses 'transcode' to
        transcode the ripped DVD. 'transcode' would add an extra 2MB to the
        image just to be able to convert the DVD to a format that cannot be
        hardware MPEG2 decoded. Therefore, 'transcode' is not included.
        However, if you add 'transcode' and its associated libraries, then
        MiniMyth will use it.

Updated init
    Changed MiniMyth to search for its configuration files in
        'conf/<hostname>' then 'conf/default', rather than 'conf/<hostname>'
        then 'conf'.
    Removed support for specal value 'default' from MM_CODECS_URL.
    Removed support for specal value 'default' from MM_THEMECACHE_URL.
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_THEME_NAME and MM_THEME_URL for
        setting the MythTV theme and adding the MythTV theme named
        MM_THEME_NAME located at the URL MM_THEME_URL to the MythTV
        theme directory.
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_THEMEOSD_NAME and MM_THEMEOSD_URL for
        setting the MythTV OSD theme and adding the MythTV OSD theme named
        MM_THEMEOSD_NAME located at the URL MM_THEMEOSD_URL to the MythTV
        theme directory.
    Added 'userspace' value for MM_CPUFREQ_GOVERNOR.
    Added minimyth.conf variable MM_MYTHDVD_URL for setting the remote
        directory where MiniMyth will create the temporary directory used by
        MythDVD's when ripping DVDs.

Updated Busybox support
    Updated version.
    Removed many unused utilities.
    Added hwclock utility, replacing standalone utility.

Updated Xorg support
    Updated version.
    Changed from monolithic version to modular version, replacing X11/X11,
        X11/libXvMCW, X11/unichrome_dri and lib/libdrm with the packages in
        xorg.
    Updated X11/unichrome version and moved X11/unichrome to
        xorg/xf86-video-openchrome.
    Updated X11/unichrome_dri version and moved X11/unichrome_dri to xorg/Mesa.
    Updated lib/libdrm version and moved lib/lidrm to xorg/libdrm.
    Changed the installation location of Xorg from /usr/X11R6 to /usr.
    NOTE: As part of the Xorg update, the installion path of many items
        referenced in the xorg.conf file have changed. Therefore, if you have
        a custom xorg.conf file, then you will need to update these locations.
           /usr/X11R6               -> /usr
           /usr/X11R6/lib/modules   -> /usr/lib/xorg/modules
           /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts -> /usr/lib/X11/fonts
           /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/rgb   -> /usr/share/X11/rgb

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.10:

Updated build system
    Updated packages to cross compile for x86_64. This uncovered some problems
        where gcc and glibc were not maintaining a clean separation between the
        native and cross environments. Also, this resulted in a platform
        independent method for determining library dependencies.
    Added x86_64 support, currently mm_GARCH=athlon64.
    Changed native system build to use system's architecture rather than
        pentium-mmx.

Added NVIVIA support
    Added initial support for NVIDIA chipset based motherboards. Everything
        should work on the ASUS A8N-VM CSM motherboard, except XvMC (which is
        not supported by the NVIDIA driver yet) and surround sound (which is
        disabled as a result of a hack to kernel/alsa-driver that is needed to
        get rid of a high pitched whine). No other motherboards are supported.
    By default, NVIDIA support is not included in the binaries. To add NVIDIA
        support to the binaries, set mm_CHIPSETS to 'nvidia via' in
        minimyth.conf.mk.

Added hdpram
    Added hdparm (and the corresponding disk/hdparm package) so that users
        can adjust CD/DVD drive parameters.

Updated init
    Moved mythtv init script to the end after all init scripts other than x.
        This allows users to override Myth database setting set by other
        init scripts by putting the settings in the minimyth.conf file.
    Added hardware clock setting to shutdown.
    Added minimyth.conf attribute MM_X_DVI_ENABLED for enabling the DVI
        output. Since the Openchrome drivers do not support DVI, it is likely
        that this attribute will not work on VIA chipset motherboards.
    Added MM_CPUFREQ_GOVERNOR for controlling CPU frequency scaling.
    Fixed problem with MM_X_MODELINE not working.

Removed smb/smbfs support
    Removed smb/smbfs support. There should be no reason to be using smb/smbfs
    rather than cifs.
    Removed package net/samba.
    Added package net/mount.cifs.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated kernel/linux.
    Updated lib/libexif.
    Updated lib/libtiff.
    Updated lib/libusb.
    Updated lirc/lirc.
    Updated myth/mythplugins-stable.
    Updated myth/mythtv-stable.
    Updated system/udev.
    Updated system/zoneinfo.
    Updated utils/strace.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.9:

Updated init
    Fixed bug that caused minimyth.script to be required.
    Fixed bug that caused tarfile (*.tar.bz2) conf and tftp URLs to fail to be
        downloaded and mounted by mm_url_mount.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated kernel/linux.
    Updated system/zoneinfo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.8:

Added awk
    Updated package utils/busybox to include awk.

Added lsdvd
    Added package utils/lsdvd.

Updated init
    Changed graphical boot from bootsplash to gensplash. Gensplash runs in
        userspace, eliminating the need for a kernel patch. In support of this
        the package system/bootsplash was removed and the package
        system/splashutils was added.
    Enabled graphical boot provided that the kernel only logs errors to the
        console, and the frame buffer resolution is 800x600 with a color depth
        of 16-bits or more.
    Patched the kernel that so by default the kernel only logs errors to the
        console, and the frame buffer resolution is 800x600 with a color depth
        of 32-bits.
    Changed to the init from sysvinit rather than the init from busybox, because
        the init from busybox leaves zombie processes. In support of this the
        package system/sysvinit was added.
    Changed init scripts, including
        moving rc from /etc to /etc/rc.d,
        moving init scripts from /etc/minimyth.d to /etc/rc.d/init.d, and
        moving configuration files to /etc/conf and /etc/conf.d.
    Added support for mounting a binary codecs directory for MPlayer and Xine
        using the variable MM_CODECS_URL.
    Added support for downloading and mounting cramfs images to *_URL
        variables by adding the support to the mm_url_mount function.
    Changed the default values for MM_EXTRAS_URL and MM_THEMECACHE_URL from
        tarfiles (*.tar.bz2) to a cramfs images (*.cmg).

Updated LIRC support
    Replaced driver specific lircd daemons with one unified daemon.
    Added reasonable defaults for MM_LIRC_DEVICE when MM_LIRC_DRIVER is set to
        imon or streamzap.

Updated mm_* commands
    Moved all mm_* commands into /etc/rc.d/functions and made them accessable
        at the command line using the single command mm_command.

Updated MPlayer and Xine
    Change MPlayer and Xine to look for binary codecs in the directory
        /usr/lib/codecs rather than /usr/lib/win32, since both MPlayer
        and Xine use /usr/lib/codecs as the default binary codecs directory.

Fixed Xine so that it obeys MM_AUDIO_TYPE
    Fixed bug in the xine configuration file.

Modified Myth frontend menus
    Removed Import menu items, because CD and DVD importing is not supported.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated devel/gcc*.
    Updated devel/gdb.
    Updated devel/glibc*.

    Updated utils/strace.
    Updated X11/aewm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.7:

Updated init
    Changed init to start logging and telnet before fetching and running
        minimyth.conf and minimyth.script. This allows logs and remote access
        to the MiniMyth front end as early as possible.
    Changed syslog to get the remote log server address from DHCP rather than
        minimyth.conf.
    Added a check to make sure that MiniMyth can connect to the Myth database.
    Changed init to not start a console or tty1 shell because they interfere
        with the bootsplash screen. However, there are now shells on tty2, tty3,
        tty4 and tty5 (and X is now on tty6).
    Stopped disabling X when debugging is enabled. If you want to disable X,
        then use MM_X_ENABLED=no.

Updated minimyth.conf
    Replaced MM_SOUND with MM_AUDIO_TYPE.
    Obsoleted MM_SOUND.
    Obsoleted MM_SYSLOG_SERVER.
    Added MM_VIDEO_ASPECT_RATIO to set the video aspect ratio. Right now, this
        is only used to control the aspect ratio for MPlayer. However, in the
        future, it may be use to clean up some of the MM_X controls.
    Added MM_VIDEO_DEINTERLACE_ENABLED to enable bob deinterlacing. This
        controls bob deinterlacing in MythTV, Xine and MPlayer.

Updated MPlayer
    Added Chris Audley's XvMC fallback patch (version 2). This enables MPlayer
        to fall back to a different video output and codec when the file
        cannot be played using XvMC with MPEG2 accelaration.
    Updated the MPlayer configuration file (/root/.mplayer/config) to enable
        MPlayer to take advantage of the XvMC fallback patch.

Added MythNews support
    Enabled the MythNews plugin.
    Added MM_MYTHNEWS_ENABLED to minimyth.conf.

Added Theora support
    Added Theora for philisophical reasons. There is no Theora content (yet).
        However, like Vorbis, Theora is a completely open codec, which is
        something that should be supported.
    Added package lib/libtheora.
    Enabled Theora support packages myth/mplayer and myth/xine-lib.

Updated packages
    Updated db/mysql.
    Updated devel/bison.
    Updated devel/libtool.
    Updated kernel/drm.
    Updated kernel/linux.

    Updated utils/util-linux.
    Updated X11/SDL.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.6:

Updated X support
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_X_DISPLAYSIZE_X and MM_X_DISPLAYSIZE_Y to
        control the horizonatal display size and the vertical display size
        respectively.

Made root file system read/write
    Used pivot_root to make root file system read/write.

Changed X window manager
    Changed X window manager from ratpoison to aewm, because ratpoison was
        causing crashes with new Unichrome driver and with upcoming X11R6.9.
    Disabled X window manager by default, because MythTV "GUI X offset" and
        "GUI Y offset" settings do not work when the X window manager running.
    Added packages X11/aewm and X11/lesstif.

Updated Mesa support
    Changed X11/X11 so that it no longer builds libOSMesa.
    Added packages X11/Mesa and lib/libdrm.
    Removed package X11/unichrome_dri because it is replaced by package X11/Mesa.

        MM_LIRC_DRIVER=mceusbnew,
        MM_LIRC_KERNEL_MODULE=lirc_mceusbnew and
        MM_LIRC_REMOTE=mceusbnew.
    Obsoleted minimyth.conf variables:
        MM_MYTHDB_SETTING_<setting>,
        MM_NAME_SERVER,

        MM_NO_VNC,
        MM_TIME_SERVER,
        MM_TV and
        MM_X_RESOLUTION.
    Obsoleted configuration files:
        localtime.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Changes since 0.18.1.4:

Updated package myth/mythplugins
    Removed UI option to enable/disable fast forward and rewind in MythMusic,
        since this can be handled better by keybindings.

Updated LIRC support
    Modified lirc.script to wait for the LIRC device to appear in the device
        file system before starting the LIRC daemon.
    Updated the mceusbnew driver.

Updated X support
    Changed minimyth.conf variable MM_X_RESOLUTION to MM_X_MODE.
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_X_RESOLUTION_X, MM_X_RESOLUTION_Y and
        MM_X_REFRESH to control the horizonatal resolution, the vertical
        resolution and vertical refresh rate respectively. Using
        MM_X_RESOLUTION_X and MM_X_RESOLUTION_Y rather than MM_X_MODE
        generates a modeline rather than using a built in modeline.
    Deprecated MM_X_RESOLUTION.

Updated init
    Replaced mm_message_display with mm_message_output.
    Updated mm_message_output so that it writes to syslog as well.

Removed package kernel/cifs
    Replaced out-of-kernel cifs module with the kernel cifs module because the
        2.6.12.2 kernel contains the same version.

Added package kernel/vt1211
    Converted kernel module vt1211 from a kernel patch to a separate package.

Removed usbtouchkit kernel patch

    Added support for updating the jumppoints table by using the
        minimyth.conf variable MM_MYTHDB_JUMPPOINT.
    Added support for updating the keybindings table by using the
        minimyth.conf variable MM_MYTHDB_KEYBINDING.

        MM_MYTHDB_SETTING.
    Deprecated the MM_MYTHDB_SETTING_<setting>.

Cleaned up X initialization
    Changed minimyth.conf variables MM_NO_X, MM_NO_XWM, MM_NO_VNC and MM_TV to
        MM_X_ENABLED, MM_X_WM_ENABLED, MM_X_VNC and MM_X_TV_TYPE respectively.
    Added minimyth.conf variables MM_X_VGA_ENABLED, MM_X_TV_ENABLED,
        MM_X_TV_OUTPUT and MM_X_RESOLUTION.
    Deprecated MM_NO_X, MM_NO_XWM, MM_NO_VNC and MM_TV.

        MM_TZ.
    Deprecated the localtime configuration file.

Added minimyth.conf and minimyth.script file error handling
    Updated the core.script to check for the existence of minimyth.conf and
        minimyth.script files.
