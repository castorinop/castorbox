== Welcome to the LNX-BBC project. ==

The LNX-BBC is a mini Linux-distribution, small enough to fit on a
CD-ROM that has been cut, pressed, or molded to the size and shape of
a business card.

LNX-BBCs can be used to rescue ailing machines, perform intrusion
post-mortems, act as a temporary workstation, and perform many other tasks
that we haven't yet imagined.  

For more information about the LNX-BBC, check out our <faq.html FAQ>,
or consult our many <lists.html mailing lists>.

If you are interested in contributing to the LNX-BBC project, or if
you just like to tinker, there is more information on the <README.html
GAR README page>.

If you're just looking to download ISO images, have a look at our
<download.html download page>.  

== Testing Needed ==

We are now in release candidate status and approaching LNX-BBC 2.1.
Please give us your best effort to bang on this.  We need to know 
right away about anything that affects booting, crashes systems,
or has other drastic effects.  It's in our <testing.html beta area>.

Our <http://www.lnx-bbc.org/builds/ automated builds> are also operational.
ISO images from builds at this point should be functional, however...

If you do find a problem, please see the "How do I file a bug against
a GAR package?" entry in the <faq.html FAQ>.
