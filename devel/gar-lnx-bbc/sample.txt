# Okay, so I want to be able to have output broken up into
# numerically-indexed files, and for there to be a central
# navigation file somewhere.

# When you process a file, you have it and a list of all the
# other files for the top-level navbar, in order.  Okay, good.
# Then you parse the file, spitting out HTML to the numbered
# output files.  Then when you're done, you have a full daturbase
# to spit out, full of context, on the end of the files (thanks
# to my table-fu).  Keen gear.

Foo:
This is how we describe a foo
isn't it nice?
  -----==-----
Yeah baby

Bar:
# Tricky things to handle:  doubled-up formatting stuff,
# overloaded symbols (star is bold, but is also used for
# unnumbered lists).

	Yeah, so now this is all part of that bar thing above.  Neat like my
feet.

	#  * Headers can contain Emphasis
#  * Emphasis can contain URLs, Emphasis
#  * URLs can contain Emphasis
#  * Rules stand alone
#  * Lists can contain Emphasis, URLs
#  * Citations can contain Emphasis, URLs, Rules, Citations, and
#       Blockquotes
#  	* no, citations cannot contain other citations -- it looks bad
#  	in lynx anyway
#  * Blockquotes stand alone

Baz:
yo yo yo G

	 * Yeah
 * go baby go
   * in da hoooouuuusssseee

# so we just keep a stack of opened tags, and use a function to
# run through each paragraph and  find each regexp and replace it
# with the tag, pushing stack state all the while.  A close
# symbol will search the stack and try to pop back until it finds
# the right tag to close, and closes all those above it.

# So we have Headers, Emphasis, Urls, Rules, Lists, Citations,
# Blockquotes, and maybe Footnotes (use URL syntax minus URL).

#  * Headers can contain Emphasis
#  * Emphasis can contain URLs, Emphasis
#  * URLs can contain Emphasis
#  * Rules stand alone
#  * Lists can contain Emphasis, URLs
#  * Citations can contain Emphasis, URLs, Rules, Citations, and
#       Blockquotes
#  	* no, citations cannot contain other citations -- it looks bad
#  	in lynx anyway
#  * Blockquotes stand alone

# B (short circuit), R (same), C, L, H, U, E

this is a test

to see if we can do

# When you process a file, you have it and a list of all the
# other files for the top-level navbar, in order.  Okay, good.
# Then you parse the file, spitting out HTML to the numbered
# output files.  Then when you're done, you have a full daturbase
