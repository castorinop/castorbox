Testing Releases

As we near a releasable state, we produce beta-quality ISOs that have
been given at least a cursory wiggle test by one or more developers.
The following lists contain the URLs and md5sums of these ISO files.
Note that some older releases may have expired due to inactivity, but
it is possible to recreate them from a date-based checkout of the GAR
tree.

If you are looking for an official final release, we recommend looking
at our <download.html download page>.

If you wish to add a build to this list, simply mail the URL and
md5sum to <http://zork.net/mailman/listinfo/lnx-bbc-devel
lnx-bbc-devel@zork.net> and one of the developers will handle it.  We
encourage people to download the <http://www.lnx-bbc.org/builds/
automated builds> and give them a wiggle test for possible inclusion
in this list!
